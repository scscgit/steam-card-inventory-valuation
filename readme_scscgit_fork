I added support for another games.

On line 36 old version was:
$market_html = access_cached($listing_url, 'market_'.$card_hash.'.html');

I had to change it so some special symbols dont cause problems file names.
$market_html = access_cached($listing_url, 'market_'.rawurlencode($card_hash).'.html');

Other than that the only changes were occurrences like
json/753/6 and 753

I had to change numbers:
CS:GO json/730/2 and 730
TF2 json/440/2 and 440
DOTA2 json/570/2 and 570
BBT json/238460/2 and 238460

(also default currency from USD to EUR)

Feel free to download and change, host on web servers etc. Header says it's open-source.
